The county borders of Ireland are demarcated in grey.
An operational layer based on the 2012 survey of unfinished housing developments is included. [Unfinished Housing 2012](https://webservices.myplan.ie/ArcGIS/rest/services/MyPlan/UnfinishedHousingSurvey2012/MapServer/1)
Additional information about the highlighted portions of the map can be accessed by clicking on them.
A final (admittedly a little arbitrary) weather side bar is included (this was part of an attempt to contrast weather with another live feed of data, such as twitter)
