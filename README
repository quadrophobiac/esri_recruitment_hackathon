#  Esri Hackathon Submission

# Note on error

The ArcGIS layer webpage 'http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f9d1df903b07405f9a59962d5244fa46' lists the URL for accessing the Unfinished Developments in the Republic of Ireland' layer as:  

'https://webservices.myplan.ie/ArcGIS/rest/services/MyPlan/UnfinishedHousingSurvey2012/MapServer/1'

Which throws an SSL security exception if navigated to by a browser. I think this accounts for why it doesn't load.

The above domain can also be navigated to without https and when this amendment is made to the FeatureLayers URL the layer will load as normal.

## Features


A 'slippy map' tha utilises the 'National Geographic' base map as its baselayer. It is centred over latitude 53.287, and longitude -6.17
The county borders of Ireland are demarcated in grey.
An operational layer based on the 2012 survey of unfinished housing developments is included. [Unfinished Housing 2012](https://webservices.myplan.ie/ArcGIS/rest/services/MyPlan/UnfinishedHousingSurvey2012/MapServer/1)
Additional information about the highlighted portions of the map can be accessed by clicking on them.
A final (admittedly a little arbitrary) weather side bar is included (this was part of an attempt to contrast weather with another live feed of data, such as twitter)
